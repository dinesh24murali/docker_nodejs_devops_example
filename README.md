# docker_nodejs_devops_example

This repo contains a simple NodeJS app that is dockerized and ready for deployment

This repo is the final app that was built following this [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zUHg7xjIqQ) video

There will be folder called `Notes` that explains in detail some of the important points and tools that are used in the tutorial

There will be a audio recording that explains the overall gist of the entire app

## Important

- While going through the video, I noticed that some of the parts (nginx docker image, ...) where not up to date, the video still had old code. So I had to debug and troubleshoot to follow the tutorial
